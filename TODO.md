# To-Do List

## CycleGen

... Previous development was done without a to-do list altogether.

- [X] Test memthres flag
- [X] Revise Oopsie dialogs
- [X] Test maxsteps flag
- [X] Remove the autocompute flag and automatically detect if it's required
- [X] Extend the autocompute system to include auto-calculation of step value
  based on start, end, and maxsteps
- [X] Create an offset flag (output var name numbers added to offset on StoPic)
- [X] Test offset flag
- [X] Restructure the beginning of the script to make it more user-friendly
- [X] Remove declarations of unused variables (oops)
- [X] Finish documentation
- [X] **FATAL BUG:** Rework the core `for(` loop to work on internally defined integers instead of user-defined floats.
- [X] Automatically delete previous start,step,end vars
- [X] Correct documentation on memthres flag
- [ ] ~~Enhance input validation~~
- [X] Reformat README.txt to follow new style
- [X] Implement the RAM-filling maxsteps feature
- [X] Implement more case-specific error-related status bar messages upon imperfect termination
- [X] Create README_CYCLEVIEW.txt
- [X] Add a GitHub-specific README, show off the logo
- [X] Add source code in plaintext form
- [X] ~~Make some examples~~ (test while you're at it)
- [X] Post-test: move variable overwriting code back a few blocks to avoid illogical clash with fillmem flag's effects
- [X] Post-test: make the buffer bigger in the fillmem flag's logic
- [X] Release CycleGen 2.0

## CycleView

- [X] Do initial tests
- [X] [Other development spontaneously occurred during a road trip to Bryce Canyon]
